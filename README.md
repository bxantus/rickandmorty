## Displaying Rick and Morty characters

1. Create a Single Page App that will have two pages: Home and Profile
2. Using the Rick & Morty APIâ€™s Character endpoint (https://rickandmortyapi.com/), create a
table on the Home page with the following columns: Avatar, Name, Species, Status.
Generate data in the table based on the received response.
3. When the user clicks on one of the names, navigate to the Profile page that will show
info about the character. Data should come from the API endpoint.
4. The character profile page should have a Back button that will navigate back to the 
table.
5. Create an input field on the Home page to search among character names. It should
have an onChange event, and you should only show rows that contain the searched
string.
